# Leboncoin-scraper

This project scrapes the real estate ads from the Leboncoin website (Leboncoin is the leading site in France for real estate ads).

The script returns the number of ads, the average price, the average price per square meter and the average seniority of all ads meeting your criteria.

For your convenience, the script also saves in an excel file all the scrapped ads, to enable further analysis.

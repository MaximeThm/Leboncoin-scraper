# Leboncoin-scraper

This project scrapes the real estate ads from the Leboncoin website (Leboncoin is the leading site in France for real estate ads).

The script returns the number of ads, the average price, the average price per square meter and the average seniority of all ads meeting your criteria.

/!\ The API used by this scraper is depreciated. The website refuses all requests :(
